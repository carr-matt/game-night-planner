#### Your GitLab pages URL

You can't find this in GitLab until after you've done a deploy
but you can figure it out yourself from your GitLab project URL.

If this is your project URL

https://gitlab.com/GROUP_NAME/PROJECT_NAME

then your GitLab pages URL will be

https://GROUP_NAME.gitlab.io/PROJECT_NAME

### Create render.com account and application

* create account on render.com
* one person create a group and invite all other members
* create a new "Web Service"
  * authenticate with GitLab and choose your project
  * Enter fields:
    * Name: name of your service
    * Root Directory: the directory of your service in your git repo.
      For this example use "sample_service".
    * Environment: Docker
    * Plan Type: Free
  * click the "Create Web Service" button to create it
  * the build will succeed and it will look like the server is running,
    most likely, in 6-10 minutes, it will fail.
  * click "Manual Deploy" -> "Deploy latest commit" and the service
    should deploy successfully.

### Update GitLab CI/CD variables

Copy the service URL for your new render.com service and then paste
that into the value for the SAMPLE_SERVICE_API_HOST CI/CD variable
in GitLab.

### Deploy it

Merge a change into main to kick off the initial deploy. Once the build pipeline
finishes you should be able to see an "under construction" page on your GitLab
pages site.
