Worked with whole team on the Authentification. It took Most of the day as there were bugs and the instructions were not complete online. We ended up having to piece a few things together via repositories and lots of google searches.

Worked on front end components. Started to explore grids and implementing it into our userdashboard page. Spent a lot of the day debugging as it was my first day cracking grids. Got the localhost 300 bug fixed and connected so we can see our front end issues as we work.
