On previous days we mostly worked together on wireframing and learning mongodb and fastapi. Today we worked together the entire day on our backend authentication. We troubleshooted together, went through the learn, and took turns pair programming. Each one of us evenly participated and were able to get our backend authentication working. It was a successful day.
