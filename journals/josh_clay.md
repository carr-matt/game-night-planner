Worked with Matt and Jazz on some of the API-design.md on matt's personal branch. Made sure everyone had signed up with boardgameatlas to get their personal API keys. As a group we talked through our wireframe and decided to incorporate new functionality on the User Dashboard. Created a tab system so users can see Liked Games, Reviews, Played Games, and Owned Games.

A lot of today was spent reviewing on our own. Personally working through MongoDB Learn since as a group we decided that's the database we want to work with. Also, spent some time going through the Authentication Learn material.
