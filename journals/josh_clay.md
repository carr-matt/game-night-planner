Worked with Matt and Jazz on some of the API-design.md on matt's personal branch. Made sure everyone had signed up with Board Game Atlas to get their personal API keys. As a group we talked through our wire-frame and decided to incorporate new functionality on the User Dashboard. Created a tab system so users can see Liked Games, Reviews, Played Games, and Owned Games.

## 11/15/22

A lot of today was spent reviewing on our own. Personally working through MongoDB Learn since as a group we decided that's the database we want to work with. Also, spent some time going through the Authentication Learn material.

## 11/16/22

On previous days we mostly worked together on reworking some of our wire-frame  and going through lots of the MongoDB and FastAPI Learns. Today we worked together the entire day on our backend authentication getting that up and running. We troubleshot a lot of the issues we had together.  We split up into groups to do some paired programming. Each one of us evenly participated and were able to get our backend authentication working. It was a successful day.

## 11/17/22

Today we made sure that we had out MongoDB up and running and then connected it to our API to make sure we were able to get API endpoints. Matt, Jazz, and myself worked on starting API endpoints and starting with our backend code.

## 11/21/22

Matt, Jazz, and myself worked entirely on API enpoints with FastAPI. I worked on code cleanup and renaming a lot of the files in our queries/routers to ensure naming was concise and well thought out. We decided a lot of this week would be dedicated to finishing our API endpoints.

## 11/22/22

Did a liveshare session with Jazz, and Matt. We all took turns writing API endpoints while the other two watched and made sure the person writing the code wasn't making any mistakes. We were able to completely knock out every one of our external API enpoints that we think we'll need as of right now.

## 11/23/22

Did some code clean up and created a boardgames.py file while setting goals for next week after Thanksgiving! Feeling really good about our progress up until this point.

## 11/28/22

Worked on learning Redux.

## 11/29/22

Focused on connecting our frontend to the backend.

## 11/30/22

Worked exclusively on writing all of our unit tests. Successfully wrote 4 of the 5 unit test that we needed. Lots of succesful front end authentication. The login and sign up pages are working properly and Joe is working on the User Dashboard components.

## 12/1/22

Finshed all of our unit test. Messed with incorporating more preferences into our OwnedIn, Owned model and our FavoriteIn, Favorite models. Worked with renaming some API paths to help with our frontend team.
