On previous days we mostly worked together on wireframing and learning mongodb and fastapi. Today we worked together the entire day on our backend authentication. We troubleshooted together, went through the learn, and took turns pair programming. Each one of us evenly participated and were able to get our backend authentication working. It was a successful day.

We worked together to connect our Mongo Express and got all of our containers running. We are fully connected to MongoDB. I've been working on planning the frontend, specifically the main page. I made the carousel, some of the headers, and the background image. Working to get the 3000 connected so I can visually see what I've been coding.

Finally got the react compenants to the localhost:3000. Work on some JSX/HTML to set up an outline for my components. Studied React Hooks and Redux.
