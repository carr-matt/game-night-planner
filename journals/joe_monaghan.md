Worked with whole team on the Authentification. It took Most of the day as there were bugs and the instructions were not complete online. We ended up having to piece a few things together via repositories and lots of google searches.

Worked on front end components. Started to explore grids and implementing it into our userdashboard page. Spent a lot of the day debugging as it was my first day cracking grids. Got the localhost 300 bug fixed and connected so we can see our front end issues as we work.

I worked all dang day long on getting a freaking button to work. The add owned button. Manipulation post request custom hook in redux was my maker and I met him. After braving through many battles most ending in defeat. After immense amounts of effort, pain and eyesore I found myself at the base of a mountain. The Mountains name was...402 error.. I megerly scraped my way up the mountain top. Fingers on the verge of carpal tunnel, backside on the edge of a bedsore, I peered over the mountain top on which I had triumphed. Unbeknownst to me, my piercing gaze was to only be met by the blinding sunlight of a 500 error caused by CORS. CORS was the sun and instead of vitamin D, it fed me an error message and despair. The night is now being spent searching on how to fix it, nay to thine hope of a solution for the night is dark and full of terrors.
