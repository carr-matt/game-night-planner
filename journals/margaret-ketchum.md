On previous days we mostly worked together on wireframing and learning mongodb and fastapi. Today we worked together the entire day on our backend authentication. We troubleshooted together, went through the learn, and took turns pair programming. Each one of us evenly participated and were able to get our backend authentication working. It was a successful day.

11/17/2022

We worked together to connect our Mongo Express and got all of our containers running. We are fully connected to MongoDB. I've been working on planning the frontend, specifically the main page. I made the carousel, some of the headers, and the background image. Working to get the 3000 connected so I can visually see what I've been coding.

11/21/2022

Finally got the react compenants to the localhost:3000. Work on some JSX/HTML to set up an outline for my components. Studied React Hooks and Redux.


11/22/2022

Was able to set up setState in sign up and login pages. Worked on charting the course of my next steps. Made more visible jsx. Communicated with the backend team for ubiquitous language.

Created modals for login and sign up


11/28/2022

Created several files for the utilization of react redux. Created Login modal.

11/29/2022

no longer doing modals, switching to regular forms on their own pages, still debugging to connect to backend on these react components.

CONNECTED BACKEND TO FRONT END. TOKEN'S WORK! CAN SIGN UP AND LOG IN


12/1/2022

Got the useNavigate to work on login and signup. started on mainpage random component.

12/2/2022

got random games to finally show up on main page.

12/5/2022

got the bones of the dropdowns for the search form ready and working on connecting to backend endpoints.

12/6/2022

got all the dropdowns to populate and all but the mechanics and categories to store the clicked options.

12/7/2022

got login and sign up functional again and made it so that login actually validates the token and only lets you login if you
have proper credentials stored in the backend. had to fiddle a lot with use effect and making functions async so that the error
message stopped popping up before the user even tried to login.

12/8/2022

now the search form works and brings back results with pictures and descriptions. want to add the category filter back, will work on that tomorrow. but basic functionality is complete.
