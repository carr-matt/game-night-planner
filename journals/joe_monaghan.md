I worked all dang day long on getting a freaking button to work. The add owned button. Manipulation post request custom hook in redux was my maker and I met him. After braving through many battles most ending in defeat. After immense amounts of effort, pain and eyesore I found myself at the base of a mountain. The Mountains name was...402 error.. I megerly scraped my way up the mountain top. Fingers on the verge of carpal tunnel, backside on the edge of a bedsore, I peered over the mountain top on which I had triumphed. Unbeknownst to me, my piercing gaze was to only be met by the blinding sunlight of a 500 error caused by CORS. CORS was the sun and instead of vitamin D, it fed me an error message and despair. The night is now being spent searching on how to fix it, nay to thine hope of a solution for the night is dark and full of terrors. 

12/8/22 
I worked on the button all day

12/9/22 
I worked on the button and finally figured it out with Matt. The button still won in the end though. I ended up getting strep throat with how stressed I was and how late I was up the past 3 days working on this freaking thing.
