* Group worked together this morning get Mongo Express added & working. Afternoon, Jazz, Josh, and I did a live coding session to kick off our backend work. Some code clean-up was done, but we all feel we need to do more research about how to properly structure things within our FastAPI service before going much further. Riley gave us some good advice for next steps.
* Updated project documentation.
* Spending the remainder of my night learning more about FastAPI.

* Today was mostly about authentication. Via VS Code Live Share and pair programming, we all struggled and stumbled our way to-- by the end of the day-- being able to create user accounts, log them in, and log them out. Woohoo!! Super proud of our group.
* Our docker-compose and requirements.txt are in a good place now. All our members can successfully build and run all containers.
* Tonight, I worked thru the MongoDB exploration in preparation for tomorrow's lecture.
